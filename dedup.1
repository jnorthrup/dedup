.Sh NAME
.Nm dedup
.Nd replace duplicate file data with a copy-on-write clone.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dedup
.Op Fl PVnvx
.Op Fl t threads
.Op Fl d depth
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
finds files with identical content using the provided
.Ar
argument(s). Duplicates are replaced with a clone of another (using
.Xr clonefile 2
). If no
.Ar
is specified, the current directory is used.
.Pp
Cloned file share data blocks with the file they were cloned from, saving space
on disk. Unlike a hardlinked file, any future modification to either the clone
or the original file will be remain private to that file (copy-on-write).
.Pp
.Nm
works in two phases. First it evaluates all of the paths provided
recursively, looking for duplicates. Once all duplicates are found, any files
that are not already clones of "best" clone source are replaced with clones.
.Pp
There are limits which files can be cloned:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
the file must be a regular file
.It
the file must have only one hard link
.It
the file and its directory must be writable by the user
.El
.Pp
The "best" source is chosen by first finding the file with the most hard links.
Files with multiple hard links will not be replaced, so using them as the source
of other clones allows their blocks to be shared without modifying the data to
which they point. If all files have a single link, a file which shares the most
clones with others is chosen. This ensures that files which have been previously
processed will not need to be replaced during subsequent evaluations of the same
directory. If none of the files have multiple links or clones, the first file
encountered will be chosen.
.Pp
Files with multiple hard links are not replaced because it is not possible to
guarantee all other links to that inode exist within the tree(s) being
evaluated. Replacing a link with a clone changes the semantics from two link
pointing at the same, mutable shared storage to two links pointing at the same
copy-on-write storage. For scenarios where hard links were previously being
used because clones were not available, future versions may provide a flag to
destructively replace hard links with clones. Future versions may also consider
cloning files with multiple hard links if all links are within the space being
evaluated and two or more hard link clusters reference duplicated data.
.Pp
.Nm
will only work on volumes that have the
.Ar VOL_CAP_INT_CLONE
capability. Currently that is limited to APFS.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar depth , Fl Fl depth Ar depth
Only traverse
.Ar depth
directories deep into each provided path.
.It Fl h
Display sizes using SI suffixes with 2-4 digits of precision.
.It Fl n , Fl Fl dry-run
Evaluate all files and find all duplicates but only print what would be done
and do not modify any files.
.It Fl P , Fl Fl no-progress
Do not display a progress bar.
.It Fl t Ar threads
The number of threads to use for evaluating files. By default this is the same
as the number of CPUs on the host as described by the
.Ar hw.ncpu
value returned by
.Xr sysctl 8 .
If the value 0 is provided all evaluation will be done serially in the main
thread.
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version
Print the version and exit
.It Fl v , Fl Fl verbose
Increase verbosity. May be specified multiple times.
.It Fl x , Fl Fl one-file-system
Prevent
.Nm
from descending into directories that have a device number different than that
of the file from which the descent began.
.It Fl ? , Fl Fl help
Print a summary of options and exit.
.El
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" If the environment variables
.\" .Ev CLICOLOR
.\" or
.\" .Ev COLORTERM
.\" are set while running in an interactive terminal,
.\" .Tn ANSI
.\" color sequences will be used.
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 and >0 if an error occurs.
.Pp
It is possible that during abnormal termination a temporary clone will be left
before it is moved to the path it is replacing. In such cases a file with the
prefix .~. followed by the name of the file that was to be replaced will exist
in the same directory as target file.
.Pp
.Xr find 1
can be used to find these temporary files if necessary.
.Pp
.Dl $ find . -name '.~.*'
.Sh EXAMPLES
Find all duplicates and display which files would be replaced by clones along
with the estimated space that would be saved.
.Pp
.Dl $ dedup -n
.Pp
Limit execution to a single thread, disable progress, and display human readable
output while deduplicating files in `~/Downloads` and `/tmp`
.Pp
.Dl $ dedup -t1 -Ph ~/Downloads /tmp

.Nm
makes a best effort attempt to replace original files with clones that have
the same permissions, metadata, and ACLs. Support for copying metadata comes
from

.
